Music Representation
=============

In short, a pet project gone horribly wrong, and extendeding far beyond what I had wanted at first. Wanting to teach myself a bit of Javascript and Html5, I decided to make something that would help me. I have difficulties reading sheet music at a decent speed, so I decided to make a small program that would randomly generate notes for me to play, with a variable speed. That way I could use it for practice and improve my piano skills.

However, now it has become a quest to create a Generic Musical Staff object which will be flexible for any use (displaying chords/notes, loading and playing MusicXML files, etc). Forgive me for any bad code, I'm new to JS and I'm really stuck in a C# mind, but hopefully it'll end up good.
